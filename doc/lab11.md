# Lab 11: Finalisation of Advanced Overcloud

## Introduction

## Next Lab

The next lab will be dedicated to configuring **instance/VM high availability**, a feature that's not explicitly related to OSP director deployments as it does **not** configure it by default, but is something that many of our customers will want to utilise with RHEL OSP 7.0.
