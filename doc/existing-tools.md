# Existing Deployment Tools - Recap

## Introduction

Red Hat has *really* suffered in the field with the existing deployment tooling, not only because we've been hindered by a lack of features and the complexity, but simply having too many tools. This has led to significant field and customer confusion and frustration - I've lost count of the opportunities that we've come up against competitors who can deploy easily and quickly. There's no doubt that our core OpenStack distribution is best of breed, but if you can't get it deployed easily and with the customers required configuration, what good is it?

You may be thinking, how is creating yet **another** tool solving the problem? We'll get to that later on. To date, we have a '*bag of installers*', all with various features, levels of maturity, and customer adoption. To name a few, we have the following-

* OpenStack Foreman Installer (OFI)
* RHEL OSP installer (Codename Staypuft)
* Packstack
* Ansible-based homebrew
* SpinalStack (via acquisition of eNovance)
* Bashstack
